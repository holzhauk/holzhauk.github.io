I am a Physics Master student at [HU Berlin](https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de/home/). Currently, I am writing my thesis in the [group of Prof. Lindner](http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~neurophys/). My project is concerned with the generalisation of the notion of the phase, which is well-defined for deterministic systems, to stochastic oscillators.

<img src="/images/abous/FRTPhaseTeaser.png" title="Isochron and Distribution of Mean-First-Return Times of an isotropic stochastic oscillator" alt="Isochron and Distribution of Mean-First-Return Times of an isotropic stochastic oscillator" >

A toolset for simulating 2D isotropic stochastic oscillators that are described by a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Additionally, it allows for the calculation of a representation of the isochron of the oscillator, that is associated with its stochastic phase, and the measurements of statistics such as the Mean-First-Return Time.
