I am a Physics Master student at [HU Berlin](https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de/home/). Currently, I am writing my thesis in the [group of Prof. Lindner](http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~neurophys/). My project is concerned with the generalisation of the notion of the phase, which is well-defined for deterministic systems, to stochastic oscillators.

Interests:

* Stochastic Processes
* Theoretical/Computational Neuroscience
* Machine Learning, AI
